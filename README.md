# BCC Adventure Park

## :love_letter: Invitation Letter

During this pandemic outbreak, the government is struggling to make zero cases each day. But, at the same time, the country has to stabilize and improve its economic sector. BCC is a huge company that runs multiple businesses. One of them is BCC Adventure Park which focuses on entertainment services. BCC wants to help the government stabilize the economic sector by reopening the Adventure Park.

The company has prepared a great strategy before reopening the park; implementing more technology into the business. This technology upgrade will be used to simplify business processes while obeying the government's health regulations. To accomplish this quickly, the company will need help. By this letter, we humbly invite you to join us on this journey to figure out the best solution. We cannot wait to see your ideas to overcome this problem.
